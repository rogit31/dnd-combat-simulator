# TODO: D&D 5e Combat Simulator

## üö® Critical/High Priority

### Data Modeling
- [ ] **Complete types to have an extensible, customizable system to base our simulations off of**
    - [ ] Our types need to fit a shape that we can: 
      - work with easily
      - extensible 
      - customizable
      - Fits with the dnd 5e api
      - informative
      - documented
    - [ ] How do characters 'decide' what action they take? We used to have a static priority list, which works ok.
    - Is there a better way, maybe by inferring what action does the most damage or healing?

## üèÜ Immediate Next Steps (This Sprint)

1. **Fix action type system** - Reconcile interface with implementation
2. **Add critical hit mechanics** - Essential for realistic combat
3. **Implement bonus actions** - Required for accurate action economy
4. **Add more targeting options** - Improve AI decision making
5. **Create basic test suite** - Ensure code quality as we expand

## üìù Notes

- Priority should be on making the core simulation as accurate as possible to real D&D 5e
- Focus on features that have the biggest impact on statistical accuracy
- Consider which features are essential vs nice-to-have for MVP
- Keep performance in mind - simulations need to run quickly for good UX
